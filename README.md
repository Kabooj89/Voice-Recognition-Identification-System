# Automatic-Spoken-Language-Identification 

This project tackles the automatic spoken language recognition by a computer. From this perspective an implementation of this kind of system has been done with the objective to recognize spoken language in telephone speech. The process of Language recognition consists of 2 modules namely: - feature extraction and feature matching. Feature extraction is the process in which we extract a small amount of data from the voice signal that can later be used to represent each Language. Feature matching involves identification of the unknown language speech by comparing the extracted features from speech input with the ones from a set of known languages model, Cepstral Coefficient Calculation and Mel frequency Cepstral Coefficients are applied for feature extraction purpose. Vector Quantization and UBM-GMM (Universal Background Model based Gaussian Mixture Modeling) algorithms are used for generating template and feature matching purpose.
